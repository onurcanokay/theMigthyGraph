# theMigthyGraph
A simple python script to plot the graph of the equation y + zi = (base)^x

Due to lack of free 3D graphing software that can use complex numbers, a program like this was necessary, in order to extinguish my ignited curiosity. This program was written using python 3.9.1, matplotlib 3.5.0 and numpy 1.20.2 to plot the graph of the equation y + zi = (base)^x with negative bases.
